 # access-blocked-sites

For frustrated users who just want to visit blocked sites at work, but are unfortunately cockblocked by overly stringent firewall rules or network policies. Proxy sites does the same thing, but you can use this if proxy sites themselves are blocked as well.

A [third-party server](https://www.heroku.com) fetches the content of the site and returns it to you.

### If you want to self-host

Follow the guide [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python), then replace the `hello/views.py` with the copy provided in this repo.
